_Info, ideas and links to public government science datasets_

This is just a brain dump of some ideas for making cool sciency projects for GovHack competitors.

Got a question? Ping me on twitter [@jesserobertson](http://twitter.com/jesserobertson). I'm going to be a data mentor at the 2015 Perth Govhack but there'll be other scientists at other locations.

Are you a data mentor for GovHack and have some stuff to contribute? Please feel free to submit a pull request or just flick me an email with the relevant details at jesse.robertson@csiro.au.
